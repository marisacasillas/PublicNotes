# Morning session (10.00–10.30)

## Research project grants
Grant type: Funds that enable you to carry out a research project

Application type: Case for support (main text of proposal):

* Introduction
* Background (lit review; defines criteria for success)
* Description of the project

All parts need to be designed to sell your project.

### The 10-sentence summary
S1. The Promise + The Importance Proposition (pt. 1): Tells the reader, in a convincing way, what you are going to achieve with your project.

S2. The Importance Proposition (pt. 2): What makes your project important to that funder?

S3–S8. Statement of a problems and statement about how you will address it with a sub-project (2 x 3 sentences): Convince your funder that your project will be successful; use the "con" problem-solving technique (we need to know _SOME_ thing for _SOME_ reason + here's how x 3).

S9. Implementation?? (missed it...)

S10. What you will do when your project is done?

_The "con" problem-solving technique:_ you need to describe three problems that your project has to overcome to be successful and make three sub-projects that solve each of thos problems. Do that by first dividing your project into three sub-projects and 'create' the problems. Then tell the narrative the other way around.

### Overview of the writing process
* Write the 10 sentences (above)
* Use the 10 sentences as a framework for writing the case for support (10 sections, each one beginning with one of the sentences, written to make sure the key sentence is true).
* 10 sentences can also serve as the Introduction and the Summary

_Goal:_ Produce a super clear case of support in which the information leaps out of the application

#### Style points to keep in mind throughout
* Most people who look at your application won't know much about your topic; they'll start with the easy places (Summary, Intro). The whole idea should be captured well in those critical parts
* Your language shouldn't add any uncecessary complexity
* Repeat the key parts such that the recipe is consistent throughout
* Create a situation in which someone who isn't an expert and who reads your grant can explain it in a convincing way to someone else—one or two people from the committee are likely gonna be responsible for selling your idea to the rest
	* Remember that the committee members make the decision: if they disagree with an external reviewer, than their opinion matters more.
* Don't assume that the complicated way that you understand your science is going to make it through the committee
* Your going to use repetitions; **be careful in using new words/ways of talking about it!** avoid any risk that readers won't know you are trying to say the same thing
* The actual plan (not the lit review) should take up the majority of the space in the proposal
* THIS IS A SALES DOCUMENT

## Strategy
* Remember that rejection is really common; continuous funding can mean writing tons of applications (~3–4 rejections for every 1 success in the UK)
	* **Minimize the pain: Apply faster than you get rejected:** write 5 or 6 applications at a time
* Think of it as a bigger project that you are trying to get funding for in different ways; **have a project and then figure out how to move what you want to do toward what the funder wants to fund**
	* **Use a small set of ideas to create multiple projects:** different outcomes, different datasets, different collaborators (your skill contributes to different questions), different approaches to the same RQ, different combinations of sub-projects
* What does the agency want to fund?: **check the funder's website** for their own advertised aims/criteria and also for projects they've already funded.
* If you get 6 rejections, it's time to develop a new set of ideas
* Be convincing and do your background research: **funders don't want to fund something that can't be done or something that someone else has already funded**

## Getting ready to write
* Find a matching funder for your project
	* Think about the specific form of the project that matches with the funder's aims (see #Strategy above)
* Define your three sub-projects: Break your project into three sequential or parallel sub-projects (may be easier to assemble them from smaller parts)
	* Design the "sub-problems" after you've designed the sub-projects you care about; background explains the problems and defines success as solving the stated problems
		* 3 is perfect; 4 is okay if necessary
		* Don't have to align with individual experiments/studies; just make sure they understand your project in terms of how your research will address your questions and _not_ in terms of what you'll be doing day-to-day
		* Don't create a "hostage" situation: when a sub-project is contingent on the _uncertain_ outcome of another sub-project
* Consider what your project promises to achieve
	* State the overall promise (sentence 1!) in terms intelligible outside of your research discipline; usually something you'll contribute to and not achieve completely
* Compile (and show) evidence that
	* your project is of interest to the chosen funder
	* would convince a skeptic that you can do the project
* If impact is part of the funding criteria
	* Have answers to the following questions: Who will benefit most from your research? How will they benefit speifically? How can you ensure they will benefit? What is their involvement in the project's development?

## The magic formula
The case for support needs to be concisely PURSUASIVE, and in a way that enables others to argue for it easily

### Four questions funders might ask themselves
1. Is the project important (to them)?
	* Direct outcomes (discoveries) vs. indirect outcomes (training, etc.)
	* Includes a convincing promise and an explanation of what makes it important to them, supported by lit review
		* In the first two sentences and first two sections
2. Will the project be successful?
	* Describe the problems you've got to solve to deliver the 'promise' and the research that will solve those problems
	* Described as problems in the background: expressed as research questions, aims, objectives, or hypotheses (use their words, e.g., "aim", "hypothesis")
	* Described as solutions in the methods/research plan (implementation), making it clear that the sub-projects will solve the problems
	* _ALWAYS_ match the bakground to the research plan, even then they are entries on a form
3. Are the applicants competent?
	* Can they carry out the project? Can their institution support it? 
	* **Publications** should give evidence that the team has the necessary skills (quality and authorship) + tracker record + environment (evidence that institution can support)
	* Make evident in CV (highlight project-specific papers), track record/environment section, proposal background, methods section
		* Always be generous to others in citations, but frame yourself as making a decisive contribution to move on to the next step
4. Would a grant be value for money?
	* Are the resources requested necessary, sufficient, and proportionate for the project?
	* Mention the resources to show how they are necessary; mention other reseources that the intstitution is contributing
	* Explain how the resources are the most appropriate of their kind and good value

## The decision process
* Applications
	* Committees are sorting through a lot of applications
	* Usually a set of 50–100 per meeting; arrive 3–6 weeks before meeting; readers delay reading them as long as possible
* Expert referees' reports
	* Written reports with evaluation and score
		* **TIP!** Get old of blank referee forms
		* They will do it better if you make it easy for them
	* 2–5 reports per application
	* Usually collected before the committee meeting, but often after
	* Often conflicting
* Designated members' reports
	* Oral report by 2 or 3 members who have read the application
	* Usually < 5 min
		* Who, what, why, how, strengths, weaknesses, summary of referees, any rebuttal, conclusion, suggested score
			* Rebuttal? Find every problem ID'd by referees and make each go away
		* One member might present 10+ grants in a day
		* 30–60 min preparation per proposal
* Discussion by all members of the committee
	* Some members reading it for the first time during the discussion (they may have read the summary beforehand)
	* Members will be conservative in scoring, even if they like the proposal, because of non-expertise
	* All members can influence the score, even those who haven't spent much time on your proposal/know much about your field


**Make it easy to...**

* analyze the case for support (referee)
* know what's in it by skimming it (committee member)
* identify importance
* evaluate success
* remember the main points (designated member)

Good intentions: Committees are unlikely to be experts in your domain byt they are likely to earnestly try and distill the most exciting top-quality bits of your proposed project; most awarded grants are shittily written, but good writing can just make it very clear that your proposal is high quality

### The formula
* **The Key Sentence Technique** (adapt if needed. e.g., if you need a section on track record or for other kinds of applications, like for a fellowship)
	* What does your project promise?
	* What makes that promise important?
	* What problems do you have to solve (three of them)?
	* Introduction to your project in one sentence
	* Implementation (for the three problems)
	* What happens next?
* Use the key sentences to start each section in the case for support
* Use the key sentences for the summary and the introduction
	* Don't be afraid to re-use the language copy-paste style
	* Crucial to every reader getting the same picture of your project, no matter what they read
* Lay your text out to make it readable
	* Message on first line of paragraph (assert then justify)
	* White space above each paragraph
	* ~6 paragraphs per page
* Tag phrases: Use the same phrase to state the problem in the implementation key sentence and the problem key sentence (teaches terms, creates a slogan)
* Case for support:
	* Intro (20%), background (30%), description (>50%)
	* Repeat key sentences and tag phrases across different other summary parts of the application
* Check resources:
	* Funders' websites
	* Andrew Derrington's [blog](https://parkerderrington.com/blog/) (not his [book](http://www.researchfundingtoolkit.org/book/); by his own recommendation)

## Long-term strategies
* Submit grants all the time
* Think in terms of big, complex projects that can be configured/studied by combining multiple parts
* Get multiple small grants that run concurrently to prove you're able to manage a big grant
