# Morning session (10.00–12.45)

## Research project grants
Grant type: Funds that enable you to carry out a research project

Application type: Case for support (main text of proposal):

* Introduction
* Background (lit review; defines criteria for success)
* Description of the project

All parts need to be designed to sell your project.

### The 10-sentence summary
S1. The Promise + The Importance Proposition (pt. 1): Tells the reader, in a convincing way, what you are going to achieve with your project.

S2. The Importance Proposition (pt. 2): What makes your project important to that funder?

S3–S8. Statement of a problems and statement about how you will address it with a sub-project (2 x 3 sentences): Convince your funder that your project will be successful; use the "con" problem-solving technique (we need to know _SOME_ thing for _SOME_ reason + here's how x 3).

S9. Implementation?? (missed it...)

S10. What you will do when your project is done?

_The "con" problem-solving technique:_ you need to describe three problems that your project has to overcome to be successful and make three sub-projects that solve each of thos problems. Do that by first dividing your project into three sub-projects and 'create' the problems. Then tell the narrative the other way around.

### Overview of the writing process
* Write the 10 sentences (above)
* Use the 10 sentences as a framework for writing the case for support (10 sections, each one beginning with one of the sentences, written to make sure the key sentence is true).
* 10 sentences can also serve as the Introduction and the Summary

_Goal:_ Produce a super clear case of support in which the information leaps out of the application

#### Style points to keep in mind throughout
* Most people who look at your application won't know much about your topic; they'll start with the easy places (Summary, Intro). The whole idea should be captured well in those critical parts
* Your language shouldn't add any uncecessary complexity
* Repeat the key parts such that the recipe is consistent throughout
* Create a situation in which someone who isn't an expert and who reads your grant can explain it in a convincing way to someone else—one or two people from the committee are likely gonna be responsible for selling your idea to the rest
	* Remember that the committee members make the decision: if they disagree with an external reviewer, than their opinion matters more.
* Don't assume that the complicated way that you understand your science is going to make it through the committee
* Your going to use repetitions; **be careful in using new words/ways of talking about it!** avoid any risk that readers won't know you are trying to say the same thing
* The actual plan (not the lit review) should take up the majority of the space in the proposal
* THIS IS A SALES DOCUMENT

## Strategy
* Remember that rejection is really common; continuous funding can mean writing tons of applications (~3–4 rejections for every 1 success in the UK)
	* **Minimize the pain: Apply faster than you get rejected:** write 5 or 6 applications at a time
* Think of it as a bigger project that you are trying to get funding for in different ways; **have a project and then figure out how to move what you want to do toward what the funder wants to fund**
	* **Use a small set of ideas to create multiple projects:** different outcomes, different datasets, different collaborators (your skill contributes to different questions), different approaches to the same RQ, different combinations of sub-projects
* What does the agency want to fund?: **check the funder's website** for their own advertised aims/criteria and also for projects they've already funded.
* If you get 6 rejections, it's time to develop a new set of ideas
* **Only follow great examples.** Are there 1-line answers to:
	* What is the overall aim?
	* What makes it important?
	* What are the overall methods?
	* What are the 3–4 main problems the project needs to solve?
	* What will happen after?
	* ... if finding and writing down those answers takes more than 10 minutes, don't follow the doc as a close example.
* Be convincing and do your background research: **funders don't want to fund something that can't be done or something that someone else has already funded**

## Getting ready to write
* Find a matching funder for your project
	* Think about the specific form of the project that matches with the funder's aims (see **#Strategy** above)
* Define your three sub-projects: Break your project into three sequential or parallel sub-projects (may be easier to assemble them from smaller parts)
	* Design the "sub-problems" after you've designed the sub-projects you care about; background explains the problems and defines success as solving the stated problems
		* 3 is perfect; 4 is okay if necessary
		* Don't have to align with individual experiments/studies; just make sure they understand your project in terms of how your research will address your questions and _not_ in terms of what you'll be doing day-to-day
		* Don't create a "hostage" situation: when a sub-project is contingent on the _uncertain_ outcome of another sub-project
* Consider what your project promises to achieve
	* State the overall promise (sentence 1!) in terms intelligible outside of your research discipline; usually something you'll contribute to and not achieve completely
* Compile (and show) evidence that
	* your project is of interest to the chosen funder
	* would convince a skeptic that you can do the project
* If impact is part of the funding criteria
	* Have answers to the following questions: Who will benefit most from your research? How will they benefit speifically? How can you ensure they will benefit? What is their involvement in the project's development?

## The magic formula
The case for support needs to be concisely PURSUASIVE, and in a way that enables others to argue for it easily

### Four questions funders might ask themselves
1. Is the project important (to them)?
	* Direct outcomes (discoveries) vs. indirect outcomes (training, etc.)
	* Includes a convincing promise and an explanation of what makes it important to them, supported by lit review
		* In the first two sentences and first two sections
2. Will the project be successful?
	* Describe the problems you've got to solve to deliver the 'promise' and the research that will solve those problems
	* Described as problems in the background: expressed as research questions, aims, objectives, or hypotheses (use their words, e.g., "aim", "hypothesis")
	* Described as solutions in the methods/research plan (implementation), making it clear that the sub-projects will solve the problems
	* _ALWAYS_ match the bakground to the research plan, even then they are entries on a form
3. Are the applicants competent?
	* Can they carry out the project? Can their institution support it? 
	* **Publications** should give evidence that the team has the necessary skills (quality and authorship) + tracker record + environment (evidence that institution can support)
	* Make evident in CV (highlight project-specific papers), track record/environment section, proposal background, methods section
		* Always be generous to others in citations, but frame yourself as making a decisive contribution to move on to the next step
4. Would a grant be value for money?
	* Are the resources requested necessary, sufficient, and proportionate for the project?
	* Mention the resources to show how they are necessary; mention other reseources that the intstitution is contributing
	* Explain how the resources are the most appropriate of their kind and good value

## The decision process
* Applications
	* Committees are sorting through a lot of applications
	* Usually a set of 50–100 per meeting; arrive 3–6 weeks before meeting; readers delay reading them as long as possible
* Expert referees' reports
	* Written reports with evaluation and score
		* **TIP!** Get old of blank referee forms
		* They will do it better if you make it easy for them
	* 2–5 reports per application
	* Usually collected before the committee meeting, but often after
	* Often conflicting
* Designated members' reports
	* Oral report by 2 or 3 members who have read the application
	* Usually < 5 min
		* Who, what, why, how, strengths, weaknesses, summary of referees, any rebuttal, conclusion, suggested score
			* Rebuttal? Find every problem ID'd by referees and make each go away
		* One member might present 10+ grants in a day
		* 30–60 min preparation per proposal
* Discussion by all members of the committee
	* Some members reading it for the first time during the discussion (they may have read the summary beforehand)
	* Members will be conservative in scoring, even if they like the proposal, because of non-expertise
	* All members can influence the score, even those who haven't spent much time on your proposal/know much about your field


**Make it easy to...**

* analyze the case for support (referee)
* know what's in it by skimming it (committee member)
* identify importance
* evaluate success
* remember the main points (designated member)

Good intentions: Committees are unlikely to be experts in your domain byt they are likely to earnestly try and distill the most exciting top-quality bits of your proposed project; most awarded grants are shittily written, but good writing can just make it very clear that your proposal is high quality

### The formula
* **The Key Sentence Technique** (adapt if needed. e.g., if you need a section on track record or for other kinds of applications, like for a fellowship)
	* What does your project promise?
	* What makes that promise important?
	* What problems do you have to solve (three of them)?
	* Introduction to your project in one sentence
	* Implementation (for the three problems)
	* What happens next?
* Use the key sentences to start each section in the case for support
* Use the key sentences for the summary and the introduction
	* Don't be afraid to re-use the language copy-paste style
	* Crucial to every reader getting the same picture of your project, no matter what they read
* Lay your text out to make it readable
	* Message on first line of paragraph (assert then justify)
	* White space above each paragraph
	* ~6 paragraphs per page
* Tag phrases: Use the same phrase to state the problem in the implementation key sentence and the problem key sentence (teaches terms, creates a slogan)
* Case for support:
	* Intro (20%), background (30%), description (>50%)
	* Repeat key sentences and tag phrases across different other summary parts of the application
* Check resources:
	* Funders' websites
	* Andrew Derrington's [blog](https://parkerderrington.com/blog/) (not his [book](http://www.researchfundingtoolkit.org/book/); by his own recommendation)

## Long-term strategies
* Submit grants all the time
* Think in terms of big, complex projects that can be configured/studied by combining multiple parts
* Get multiple small grants that run concurrently to prove you're able to manage a big grant


# Afternoon session (13.45–17.00)
Primarily focused on exercises

## Pairing exercise
Pair an aim (problem) with an objective (implementation). We need to know X because Y. We will do Z and it will tell us X.

### My attempt for the EU-HomeBank project:

**We need to know X because Y.**

We need to know how the human sensory system constrains children's early word learning across languages because ...

* _Humanities foundation:_ ir will shed light on the cognitive origins and limits of the unique capacity for complex language. 
* _Public health foundation:_ we can utilize universal processes for language learning to support the development and maintenance of language skills in adults and children.

**We will do Z and it will tell us X.**

We will investigate whether children across the globe break into language by learning words that reflect real-world aesthetic experiences ("iconic" words; e.g., cock-a-doodle-doo), which will tell us how the human sensory system constrains early language learning.

## Promise sentence exercise
The first sentence should make the reader want to keep reading. Remember that the committee member might have 100 other applications to read.

_Goal:_ Create a plausible and attractive promise.

**The sentence should include three elements:**

* _The big picture:_ likely to advance an important area of knowledge
* _How it will achieve it:_ likely to be successful
* _Reference to achievements:_ you are competent to carry out the project

(all in about 25 words)

### Exercise
1. Interview neighbor (3 min)
2. Swap roles (3 min)
3. Write sentence for your beighbor's project (2 min)
4. Write a sentence for your own project (2 min)
5. Optimize and discuss

### My notes on Amie's project
- MEG multi-task with production and comprehension tasks based on prev research
how do you coordinate
- have used MEG for this kind of task, but would like to vary the overlap timing
- how people do stuff in conversation in real life
- MEG specifically because good source localization which is important to know about 
- we spend most of our lives trying to multi-task, but we still manage
- dual task and language lit never talk to each other 

### Amie's project (my attempt)
The aim of this project is to better understand how different areas of the brain coordinate rapidly to enable everyday conversation by making precision measurements of brain activity via MEG while participants do tasks where they must rapidly switch between speaking and listening, building on innovative real-time interaction experiment methods we recently developed.

### My EU-HomeBank project (my attempt)
The aim of this project is to uncover how children's everyday experience of sights, sounds, tastes, and textures shapes the foundation for their language learning by studying children's early productive vocabulary across a range of everyday contexts in homes across Europe, North America, and other regions of the globe by significantly expanding on a set of tools and recording collections we have previously used for comparative projects on children's early language development.

### My EU-HomeBank project (Amie's attempt)
The aim of the project is to discover whether shared ss drive languaglg across a diverse range of languages and culres by cuollecting and analyzign daylong recs of infants' early speech using techniques i have established in prev data collection

### My EU-HomeBank project (my attempt 2)
This project will examine how the sights, sounds, tastes, and textures of young children's everyday lives creates a foundation for their language learning by analyzing a diverse collection of recordings made during whole waking days in family homes around the globe, extending tools we developed in a previous multi-site comparative project.

## Writing guidelines
* The reader should know why they're reading what they are reading. The assert-then-justify approach (i.e., make a statement and then explain it) is a useful tool for doing that.
* Use repetition of a small set of unambiguous words:
	* Avoid synonyms, particularly for key terms. Instead, pick the best term and use it repeatedly
	* Avoid homonyms
	* Use tag phrases
	* "it doesn't look boring, it looks clear"
* Keep it short
	* Short paragraphs (~6 per page)
	* Short sentence: avoid adverbs, adjectives, and nominalizations
* Use headings, sub-headings, and white space
	* Re-use phrases from the key sentences
* Parallel writing: use similar structures for sentences with similar function
* Avoid value claims and state evidence instead
* Bullet lists are good, but lists inside paragraphs are bad
* Avoid coining new abbreviations/initializations/acronyms altogether if possible (okay if they're common, existing ones)


## Write the Problem & Implementation sentences
Describe a sub-project and say what problem it will solve. Remember that the sub-projects need to be defined _before_ you define the problem.

**For each implementation pair you need to identify:**

1. What the research will consist of
2. What the outcome will be

**Common mistakes:**

* Failing to describe research
* Failing to say what problem it solves
* Forgetting to use the same description as the problem sentences
* Changing the syntactic structure unnecessarily
* Too long

### My first attempt at sub-projects for EU-HomeBank
1. Collect CDI & LENA data from EU and other language families for kids between 1;6 and 3;0
2. Annotate and analyze use of early lexicon (other vs. perception verbs and iconic words) in children's speech
3. Annotate and analyze contexts of use for perception verbs and iconic words in children's speech

## Write the Project and Next sentences
The Project sentence summarizes the project in whatever way is appropriate. If they only read 1 sentences about your project, it will be this one. Summarize the project or state its scope. Go beyond the Promise sentence.

The Next sentences introduces your discussion of what will happen after the research is complete. It will depend on whether the importance is academic or practical or both (e.g., state in ~40 words what you will do to maximize the benefit from the project).

## Write the Global Sales Pitch
Also known as the **Elevator pitch**. This sentence should state why they outcome is important:
1. Give some stats/evidence for a real-world problem the project will help solve2. Say what the project will allow us to do that we can’t do now3. Prepare to say which funder priorities it contributes to (and how)
